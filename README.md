# :sunrise_over_mountains: Viewimage
Google [removed the "View Image" button](https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/964226180776845312) on the 15th of February. This is a bookmarklet that allows you to download the full-size photo you're currently viewing.

Tested on Chromium 63 and Firefox 57.

## Usage
1. [Head over here](https://d3vr.github.io/viewimage/) and drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.
2. Go to Google Images, click on any image to view it, wait for the preview to finish loading, then click on the bookmarklet. The full-size photo should open on a new tab.
3. Enjoy

## Alternative
If you'd like a browser extension or a userscript, @devunt [has done just that](https://github.com/devunt/make-gis-great-again).
